					<ul>
						<li>James Clerk Maxwell was born in Edinburgh in 1831. He attended school in the city and later studied at the Universities of Edinburgh and Cambridge</li>
						<li>He was an intensely curious child, writing his first scientific paper at the age of 14. At 25 he became Professor of Physics at Aberdeen University's Marischal College.</li>
						<li>In Aberdeen, Clerk Maxwell began to study the composition of Saturn's rings. For many years, scientists had been trying to understand why they did not simply break up, crash into or move away from the planet.</li>
						<li>Clerk Maxwell spent two years researching the subject and wrote his detailed essay 'On the Stability of Saturn's Rings' in 1859.</li>
						<li>He concluded the rings comprised a myriad of small solid particles. The Voyager space probes of the 1980s confirmed many of the conclusions drawn by Clerk Maxwell over a century before.</li>
						<li>In 1860, Clerk Maxwell moved from Aberdeen to King's College London, where he remained until 1865.</li>
						<li>In 1873, he developed the famous four Maxwell's equations which played a key role in Albert Einstein's work on the special theory of relativity.</li>
						<li>Clerk Maxwell’s discovery of the nature of electromagnetic waves forms the basis for much of the modern technological society we take for granted. Radio, television, satellite communications and the mobile phone have their origins in his work.</li>
						<li>In 1879, James Clerk Maxwell’s health began to fail. Following a summer visit to the family estate in Kirkcudbrightshire, he returned to Cambridge where he died on 5 November.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Einstein stated <span>"The special theory of relativity owes its origins to Maxwell Equations of the electromagnetic field."</span></p>
